## hmctl config

Read and modify Pure Fusion client config files

### Synopsis

Read and modify Pure Fusion client config files

hmctl reads configuration from $HOME/.pure/fusion.json. This can be changed by
setting $FUSION_CONFIG to the path of a different configuration file.

Each configuration file is organized into "profiles" where each profile
contains an API client and a path to the client's private key in PEM format.
To use a specific profile, add '--profile PROFILE_NAME' to your command, or run
'hmctl config use-profile PROFILE_NAME'.

New profiles are added to your configuration when running 'hmctl api-client create'

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for config
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --output-format string   Output format (default "pretty-print")
      --profile string         Configuration profile to use
```
